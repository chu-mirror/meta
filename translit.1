.TH TRANSLIT 1 "13 November 20"
.SH NAME
translit \- transliterate characters 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBtranslit\fR [\fB^\fR]\fIsrc\fR \fIdest\fR
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I translit 
maps its input, 
on a character by character basis, 
and writes the translated version to its output. 
In the simplest case, 
each character in the argument 
.I src 
is translated to the corresponding character 
in the argument 
.IR dest ; 
all other characters are copied as is.
.PP
Both arguments may contain substrings 
like 'a-e' of the form c1-c2 as shorthand for
all of the characters in the range c1..c2. 
It's recommanded to use c1, c2, 
which both be digits, 
or be letters of same case.
.PP
If 
.I src 
is longer than 
.IR dest , 
the characters in 
.I src 
can not find a corresponding character 
in 
.I dest 
will be translated to the last character of 
.IR dest .
.PP
Finally, if 
.I src 
is preceded by a 
.BR ^ , 
then 
.I all but 
the characters represented by
.I src 
are taken as the source string, 
and be mapped to the last character of 
.IR dest .

Both 
.I src 
and 
.I dest 
consist of characters represent themselves mostly, 
the interpreted sequences are:

\\n, means \fInewline\fP; \\d, means \fIdelete this character\fP; \\t, means \fItab\fP.
